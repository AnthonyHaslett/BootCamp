--------------------------------Graphical Data web solution ---------------------------------------------------

This readme contains the necessary information required to successfully utilise our web solution.


-------------------------------Navigation----------------------------------------------------------------------

to navigate throughout the web solution, the user needs to interact with the multiple dropdown-menu buttons displayed on the left hand side of the page. 
These buttons have the appropriate labels on them to clearly identify the types of data that will be displayed in each graph, and each button contains a maximum of 2 graphs
that display a set of data.

-------------------------------How the solution works----------------------------------------------------------

The solution uses a set of advanced SQL queries that filter data from a given database, utilising a set of rules in order to grab specific types of data that is required
to be displayed in a graphical format. The SQL statements are executed within the PHP script, and the results are deposited into PHP variables, which are used within
the JavaScript graphs in order to project the necessary values. 

It uses a function-based refresh method that re-executes the SQL queries every second, in order to project real-time data into the graphs, so the user is 
never delayed on receiving data and never has to refresh the page in order to see results. 

-------------------------------Step by step introduction------------------------------------------------------

Once the page has been loaded up, and the SQL statements along with it, the user will only need to follow a small set of simple interactions in order to successfully
use this solution. The steps are as follows:

1. 	Navigate to the left-side navigation pane
2.	Select an appropriate navigation buttonbased on the labels
3.	Upon selecting, click the navigation button to activate the drop-down menu
4.	Select and click on the appropriate graph you require, with options of either a column chart or pie chart
5.	Examine the data, by reading the output, utilising the keys to determine the data by colour, or simply by hovering the mouse over the specific element in order
to activate an annotation that projects both the element name and it's exact value.

Following these steps for each graph will allow you to successfully use this solution.
